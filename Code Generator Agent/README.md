This code implements:

    A comprehensive checklist system for AI agent quality validation with:

        CUDA Compatibility check

        Quantization validation

        MCP + Function Calling verification

        Cognitive & Agentic RAG testing

        Retrieval performance validation

        Safety checks (hallucinations, command execution)

        Human evaluation integration

        Optimization profiling

        Pre-TDD readiness checks

    Key features:

        Status tracking for each checklist item (Passed/Failed/Warning)

        Detailed validation metrics storage

        Comprehensive report generation (JSON format)

        Console output for quick status checks

        Configurable thresholds for each validation

    Example usage showing how to:

        Create a quality report for an agent

        Provide validation data

        Run all checks

        View results

        Save full report

The system is designed to be extensible - you can easily add new checklist items or modify validation logic for specific needs. The report output can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines or quality monitoring dashboards.
