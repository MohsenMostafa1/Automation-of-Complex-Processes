# Simplifying AI Agent Quality Checklist for PM

Introducing Your AI-Powered Project Manager Agent
Streamline Sprint Planning with Automation

Managing software development sprints can be time-consuming, with repetitive task breakdowns, role assignments, and progress tracking. Our AI Project Manager Agent automates these processes, allowing your team to focus on building great productsâ€”while the agent handles the planning.
How It Works

The agent combines open-source AI and task management tools to:

  Break Down Goals Automatically

  Uses a local Hugging Face LLM (like Zephyr-7B) to convert high-level goals (e.g., "Implement user authentication") into actionable subtasks.

  Example output:
  
 ```python
 - Research authentication libraries  
 - Design login UI  
 - Implement OAuth integration  
 - Write unit tests  
```

Assign Tasks Intelligently

Matches tasks to team members based on roles (Dev, QA, Designer).

Ensures balanced workload distribution.

Sync with Your Tools

Creates tasks directly in Taiga (open-source Jira alternative) or GitHub Issues.

Logs all tasks in a SQLite database for auditability.

Provide Full Visibility

REST API (FastAPI) for integration with your existing systems.

Real-time sprint tracking via /sprints/{id} endpoint.

Key Features

Open-Source Stack

LLM: Hugging Face Zephyr-7B (replace with any model)

Project Management: Taiga (self-hosted Jira alternative)

Database: SQLite (easy to switch to PostgreSQL)

FastAPI Endpoints

POST /sprints/ - Create new sprint with AI task generation

GET /sprints/{id} - Retrieve sprint details

GET /health - Service health check

Production-Ready

Error handling and logging

 Database transactions

 Async-ready (add async/await as needed)

 Automatic Task Assignment 
```python
# Example team input
{
  "goal": "Implement user authentication",
  "project_id": 1,
  "team": [
    {"name": "Alice", "role": "Dev"},
    {"name": "Bob", "role": "QA"}
  ]
}
```

Setup Instructions

    Install dependencies
```python
pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers requests python-dotenv
```
Configure Taiga
```python
docker-compose up -d  # See Taiga's official docs
```
Run the API
 ```python
python app.py
```
Test with curl
```python
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/sprints/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"goal": "Build login page", "project_id": 1, "team": [{"name": "Dev", "role": "Dev"}]}'
```
